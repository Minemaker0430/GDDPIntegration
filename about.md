# GDDP Integration

A mod made by Minemaker0430 that adds a new menu to the game, where you can keep track of your progression!

#IMPORTANT INFO

This mod is still in the Alpha stages, due to how new the List feature is in GD. There's not enough information about requesting Lists from the server or finished Geode functions yet to do what I want to do with the mod. I'll try my best to update it when I can make progress but this is the best I can do for now. I'm sorry :(

If you have any information on server endpoints/things I could do to translate Lists into menus, please message me on discord @minemaker0430. Thanks!
